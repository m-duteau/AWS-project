# AWS-project

The provided screenshots are presented in order to demonstrate the experience gained through working with Amazon Web Services for an academic project at Southern New Hampshire University. The AWS learner lab is no longer accessible as of the course's completion, so these images seek to serve as evidence for my application of AWS methods in order to deploy a functioning full stack application called Learn Angular From Scratch (LAFS).
